# Jobs to be Done 

## Primary JTBD
"When I receive ambiguous professional communication, I want to understand the sender's actual intent and emotional tone, so I can respond appropriately without damaging relationships or creating workplace anxiety."
Example: Getting a terse "We need to talk" email from your manager and not knowing if you're in trouble or if they're just busy.

## Secondary JTBD
"When I need to respond to sensitive or complex workplace situations, I want pre-written script options that match the appropriate tone, so I can communicate professionally without spending hours crafting the perfect response."
Example: A client complains about a missed deadline - you need to de-escalate without being defensive.
"When I'm preparing for important conversations, I want to practice what I'll say with realistic voice feedback, so I feel confident and won't freeze up during the actual interaction."
Example: Rehearsing for a performance review or difficult conversation with a colleague.

## Supporting JTBD
"When I'm in the middle of a live conversation, I want discreet prompts and talking points, so I can stay on track and contribute meaningfully without losing my train of thought."
Example: Zoom meetings where you know what you want to say but can't organize it quickly enough.
"When I want to improve my communication skills over time, I want to track my progress and identify patterns, so I can build confidence and recognize my growth."
Example: Seeing that you've successfully handled 15 difficult emails this month using the app's suggestions.

## The Emotional Job
"When facing any communication challenge, I want to feel capable and confident rather than anxious and overwhelmed, so I can participate fully in professional and social situations."
This emotional outcome - moving from anxiety to confidence - is what ties all the functional jobs together and drives user retention.
